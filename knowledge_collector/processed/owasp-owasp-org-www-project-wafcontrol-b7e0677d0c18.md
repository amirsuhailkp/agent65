# OWASP WAFControl

**The 1st Modern Web-Based GUI Dashboard for ModSecurity & OWASP CRS**

OWASP WAFControl is an open-source project that revolutionizes how security teams deploy and manage the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) and ModSecurity. Traditionally, setting up and tuning CRS requires deep technical knowledge and heavy command-line operations. WAFControl eliminates this barrier by providing a powerful, intuitive, and secure web-based GUI that automates installation, configuration, and management of CRS + ModSecurity, making advanced WAF protection accessible to everyone.

Our mission is to empower DevSecOps teams, security engineers, and administrators with a visual, streamlined platfor for WAF management reducing complexity while increasing security, visibility, and operational efficiency.

The official website of the project can be found at <https://wafcontrol.org>.
